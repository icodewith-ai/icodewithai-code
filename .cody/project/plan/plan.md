## Overview
_A quick summary of what this plan is for and what product it's implementing._

**This plan implements the iCodeWith.ai educational platform, a Hugo-based static site that teaches Spec Driven Development and AI-assisted coding through multiple content formats. The platform is currently at version 1.4.3 with completed multi-presenter support and a mature content management system. This plan focuses on maintaining and evolving the existing production platform.**

## Architecture
_High-level structure and major technical decisions. Include how the system is organized (e.g., client-server, monolith, microservices) and the proposed tech stack (frameworks, languages, storage, deployment)._

**Static Site Architecture with Serverless Backend:**
- **Frontend**: Hugo static site generator with custom icodewithai theme
- **Backend**: Netlify Functions for form processing and API integrations
- **Deployment**: Multi-repository architecture (dev → staging → production)
- **Hosting**: GitHub Pages for static content, Netlify for serverless functions
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions workflows with automated testing and deployment
- **Content Management**: File-based content with Hugo archetypes and automated scripts
- **Performance**: Hugo Pipes for asset optimization, lazy loading, and cache management

## Components
_What are the key parts/modules of the system and what do they do?_

- **Content Management**: Hugo-based system with blog, podcast, presentations, and Show & Tell sections
- **Theme System**: Custom icodewithai theme with responsive design and component library
- **Multi-Presenter System**: Support for multiple presenters in presentations and podcasts
- **Photo Gallery Component**: Interactive image galleries for app showcases
- **Navigation System**: Responsive header/footer with mobile menu and dropdown components
- **SEO System**: Comprehensive meta tags, Open Graph, and search engine optimization
- **Form Processing**: Netlify Functions for contact forms and newsletter subscriptions
- **Asset Pipeline**: Hugo Pipes for SCSS compilation, JavaScript minification, and image processing
- **People Management**: JSON-based profiles for presenters, guests, and contributors
- **Deployment System**: Multi-environment CI/CD with automated testing and deployment

## Data Model
_What are the main types of data or objects the system will manage?_

- **Content Types**: Blog posts, podcast episodes, presentations, Show & Tell entries, app showcases
- **People Profiles**: JSON files with presenter/guest information, photos, and biographical data
- **App Data**: Page bundles with metadata, thumbnails, and photo galleries
- **SEO Metadata**: YAML files for search engine optimization and social media integration
- **Configuration**: Hugo TOML files for site settings, navigation, and environment-specific configurations
- **Asset Resources**: Images, CSS, JavaScript processed through Hugo Pipes with fingerprinting

## Major Technical Steps
_What are the major technical steps required to implement this product? Keep the tasks high-level and milestone-focused (e.g., "Build user input form," not "Write handleInput() function"). These will guide the AGENT or dev team in breaking down the work further._

- **Content System Maintenance**: Ongoing content creation, SEO optimization, and content architecture improvements
- **Performance Optimization**: Core Web Vitals improvements, asset optimization, and build performance
- **Feature Enhancements**: New components, functionality improvements, and user experience upgrades
- **Security Hardening**: Regular security audits, dependency updates, and vulnerability remediation
- **Accessibility Compliance**: WCAG AA compliance testing and remediation
- **Community Integration**: Discord integration improvements and community engagement features
- **Documentation Management**: Maintain comprehensive documentation using Cody Framework structure
- **Testing and Quality Assurance**: Automated testing, manual QA, and best practices enforcement

## Tools & Services
_What tools, APIs, or libraries will be used?_

- **Hugo Static Site Generator**: Core framework for content management and site generation
- **GitHub Actions**: CI/CD automation and deployment workflows
- **GitHub Pages**: Production hosting for static content
- **Netlify Functions**: Serverless backend for form processing and API integrations
- **SCSS/Bulma**: CSS framework and styling architecture
- **JavaScript (Vanilla)**: Client-side interactivity and component functionality
- **Resend API**: Email service for contact forms and newsletters
- **Spotify/Apple Podcasts**: Podcast hosting and distribution
- **Discord**: Community platform integration
- **14-Agent AI Development System**: Specialized AI agents for development, testing, and maintenance

## Risks & Unknowns
_What might block us, or what needs more investigation?_

- **Content Creation Bottlenecks**: Dependency on regular content creation and guest availability for podcasts/presentations
- **Platform Scalability**: GitHub Pages limitations for high-traffic scenarios and bandwidth constraints
- **Community Engagement**: Maintaining active Discord community and user engagement over time
- **SEO Competition**: Standing out in the crowded developer education and AI coding content space
- **Technology Evolution**: Keeping up with rapid changes in AI tools and development practices
- **Multi-Environment Complexity**: Managing staging and production deployments with potential sync issues

## Milestones
_What are the major implementation phases or delivery checkpoints?_

- **Phase 1 - Platform Stability** (Completed): Core Hugo site, multi-presenter support, responsive design
- **Phase 2 - Content System** (Completed): Blog, podcast, presentations, Show & Tell sections with automation
- **Phase 3 - Community Integration** (Completed): Discord integration, social media optimization, SEO system
- **Phase 4 - Performance Optimization** (Ongoing): Core Web Vitals improvements, asset optimization, accessibility
- **Phase 5 - Advanced Features** (Future): Interactive elements, advanced community features, API integrations
- **Phase 6 - Scaling and Growth** (Future): Enhanced content delivery, advanced analytics, premium features

## Environment Setup
_What setup steps are needed to start development or run the app?_

- **Install Hugo Extended** (minimum version for SCSS processing)
- **Clone repository** and initialize submodules if using theme as submodule
- **Install Node.js dependencies** (if using additional build tools)
- **Configure environment variables** for Netlify Functions (API keys, etc.)
- **Setup GitHub Pages** deployment keys and repository access
- **Configure Discord webhook** for community integration
- **Setup Cody Framework** using `:cody activate` for development workflow
- **Test local development** with `hugo server --environment local`
- **Verify deployment pipeline** with staging environment before production
