# v1.1.9 Migrate Images to Hugo Pipes - Checklist

## Pre-Migration Setup

### Discovery Phase
- [x] Search for `marcelolewin.jpg` references in all template files
- [x] Search for `logo.png` references in all template files  
- [x] Search for `icon-contentful-certified-content-manager.png` references
- [x] Search for `icon-contentful-certified-professional.png` references
- [x] Document all current usage locations and patterns
- [x] Note current file sizes for comparison

### Environment Preparation
- [x] Test current Hugo build works correctly
- [ ] Take screenshots of affected pages for comparison

## Migration Implementation

### File Structure Changes
- [x] Create `themes/icodewithai/assets/images/` directory
- [x] Move `marcelolewin.jpg` to assets/images/
- [x] Move `logo.png` to assets/images/
- [x] Move `icon-contentful-certified-content-manager.png` to assets/images/
- [x] Move `icon-contentful-certified-professional.png` to assets/images/
- [x] Verify favicon files remain in static/images/

### Template Updates
- [x] Update references in `layouts/partials/footer.html` (logo.png)
- [x] Update references in `layouts/partials/header.html` (logo.png)
- [x] Update references in `layouts/bio/single.html` (marcelolewin.jpg + 2 certificate icons)
- [x] Update references in `layouts/index.html` (no references found)
- [x] Update references in `layouts/_default/baseof.html` (no references found)
- [x] Update any other template files found during discovery
- [x] Add error handling for missing images in all updated templates

### Hugo Pipes Implementation
- [x] Convert static image paths to `resources.Get` calls
- [x] Add image optimization (fingerprinting) where beneficial
- [x] Implement proper error handling for missing images
- [x] Add lazy loading attributes where appropriate

## Testing & Validation

### Build Testing
- [x] Run `hugo --minify` successfully
- [x] Verify no build errors or warnings
- [x] Check `/public/` folder for correctly generated image files
- [x] Verify fingerprinted URLs are generated (cache busting)

### Visual Testing
- [ ] Compare before/after screenshots of affected pages
- [x] Test on desktop browser
- [ ] Test on mobile browser
- [x] Verify image quality maintained
- [x] Check responsive behavior

### Functional Testing
- [x] Verify all images load correctly
- [x] Check image alt text displays properly
- [x] Test lazy loading behavior (if implemented)
- [x] Verify no broken image references

### Performance Testing
- [x] Compare file sizes before/after optimization
- [x] Test page load performance
- [x] Verify cache busting works (URLs change when images updated)
- [x] Check browser developer tools for proper asset loading

## Documentation Updates

### Architecture Documentation
- [x] Update `.vibedocs/architecture/folder-structure.md` with new asset structure
- [x] Update `.vibedocs/architecture/content-management.md` with image guidelines
- [x] Update `.vibedocs/architecture/components.md` with Hugo Pipes image patterns

### Project Documentation
- [x] Document new image optimization workflow
- [x] Add guidelines for future theme image additions
- [x] Update development workflow documentation
- [x] Create comprehensive retrospective document

## Quality Assurance

### Code Review
- [ ] Review all template changes for consistency
- [ ] Verify error handling is implemented properly
- [ ] Check that coding patterns follow Hugo best practices
- [ ] Ensure accessibility attributes are maintained

### Cross-Browser Testing
- [ ] Test in Chrome
- [ ] Test in Firefox
- [ ] Test in Safari
- [ ] Test on mobile browsers

### Performance Validation
- [ ] Run lighthouse audit on affected pages
- [ ] Verify Core Web Vitals not negatively impacted
- [ ] Check network tab for proper asset loading

## Deployment Preparation

### Final Checks
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Documentation complete
- [ ] No console errors in browser

### Rollback Preparation
- [ ] Document rollback procedure
- [ ] Have backup plan if issues discovered post-deployment

## Post-Migration Validation

### Production Testing (After Deployment)
- [ ] Verify all pages load correctly in production
- [ ] Check image loading across different devices
- [ ] Verify cache busting working in production environment
- [ ] Monitor for any error reports

### Performance Monitoring
- [ ] Compare production page load times
- [ ] Monitor Core Web Vitals
- [ ] Check CDN/cache behavior with fingerprinted URLs

## Success Metrics

### Technical Achievements
- [ ] All images successfully migrated to Hugo Pipes
- [ ] File sizes reduced through optimization
- [ ] Cache busting URLs generated automatically
- [ ] No broken image references

### Quality Improvements
- [ ] Consistent asset pipeline (SCSS, JS, Images)
- [ ] Better error handling for missing images
- [ ] Improved developer experience for image management
- [ ] Enhanced performance through optimization

### Documentation Completion
- [ ] Architecture documentation updated
- [ ] Component documentation expanded
- [ ] Future workflow guidelines established
- [ ] Migration lessons documented

## Final Sign-off

- [ ] All checklist items completed
- [ ] Visual regression testing passed
- [ ] Performance goals met
- [ ] Documentation approved
- [ ] Ready for production deployment
