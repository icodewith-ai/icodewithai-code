# Release Retrospective â€“ v1.4.0-rename-tutorials-to-built-with-vibes
This document reflects on what worked, what didn't, and how future releases can be improved.

## Release Summary
Successfully completed comprehensive rebranding of "Tutorials" section to "Built with Vibes" across entire codebase. This involved 31 tasks across 7 phases, including directory structure changes, template updates, CSS renaming, configuration changes, content updates, testing, and final cleanup. All functionality maintained while transitioning to new show format concept.

## What Went Well
_List things that were successful or effective during this release._

- **Systematic Approach**: The 7-phase breakdown made the complex rename manageable and trackable
- **Hugo Template Flexibility**: Hugo's directory-based routing made URL changes seamless 
- **Build System Robustness**: No build errors throughout the entire process
- **Comprehensive Testing**: User validation at Phase 6 caught and confirmed everything working
- **Variable Naming Strategy**: Converting to camelCase for template variables avoided syntax errors
- **Incremental Commits**: Phase-by-phase commits allowed for safe rollback points
- **Asset Management**: Hugo's resource pipeline handled image path changes smoothly

## What Could Have Gone Better
_List things that caused friction, confusion, or delays._

- **Initial Template Variable Issue**: Created invalid Hugo variables with hyphens initially (line 24 error)
- **Icon Filename Oversight**: Almost missed renaming the icon file for complete consistency
- **Search Scope**: Could have been more systematic about searching all file types initially

## Lessons Learned
_Both human and AI can add insights here. Focus on what to repeat or avoid in the future._

- **Hugo Variables**: Template variables must use camelCase, not kebab-case (hyphens)
- **CSS vs Variables**: CSS classes can have hyphens, but Hugo template variables cannot
- **Asset Consistency**: When renaming sections, check all related asset filenames
- **Testing Early**: The build error caught early prevented larger issues later
- **Documentation Value**: Vibedocs process kept everything organized and trackable

## Action Items
_Concrete steps or process changes to carry forward into the next release._

- **Pre-flight Checks**: Always test Hugo syntax after bulk find/replace operations
- **Asset Inventory**: Create checklist of all related assets when renaming sections
- **Search Strategy**: Use multiple search patterns (files, templates, config, assets) systematically  
- **Build Verification**: Run `hugo --minify` after each major phase for early error detection
- **Naming Conventions**: Document Hugo template variable naming rules for future reference
