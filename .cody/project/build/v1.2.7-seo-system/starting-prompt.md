I would love to have a central location for me to update all my seo information for my site.

We have some defaults which include:

title: "iCodeWith.ai"
separator: "|"
description: "With AI, we can now code and build apps faster than ever before. The barrier to entry is gone. Anything is possible. Letâ€™s build something great together."
socialMediaImage: "https://icodewith.ai/socialmediaimage.png"
favicon: "https://icodewith.ai/favicon.png"

THe above are sample values.

Then we have actual pages:
home page
apps list page
blog list page
podcast list page
presentations list page
about marcelo

then we have content pages (using single.html layout pages) for:
apps
blog
podcast
presentation

Right now, we have SEO everywhere.   

I would love to have 1 place where all SEO content is updated in.

Maybe a partial called SEO that is populated as part of the build (and inserted into the header)

The goal of this release would be
1) Make sure all pages have SEO
2) Standardize all the SEO information
3) Centralize SEO content into one location

I think we need to have defaults, so I don't need to define for a page, say a title, and it will inherit default (I think, though, I should say title: default, so I know what I'm doing.)

Eeach page should have:

title
description
social media images

Anything else you can think of. 

What are your thoughts on this and what can be done?
