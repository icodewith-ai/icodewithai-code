# Starting Prompt: Presentation Images Feature

## Original Request

User requested implementation of presentation images feature with the following requirements:

1. Add presentation images similar to how tutorial images work
2. Images should display in the presentations list page (`themes/icodewithai/layouts/presentations/list.html`)
3. Images should display at the top of individual presentation pages (`themes/icodewithai/layouts/presentations/single.html`), below the title

## Examination Request

User requested examination of:
- How tutorial images are currently implemented
- The presentation template files mentioned
- The .vibedocs directory structure  
- Existing image handling patterns in the codebase

## Context

The user wants to follow existing patterns and conventions in the codebase, specifically mirroring how tutorial images currently work but adapting them for the presentations section.

## Deliverables Requested

1. Create appropriate version directory structure in .vibedocs (v1.3.9-presentation-images)
2. Create detailed plan.md file including:
   - Feature overview
   - Technical implementation details
   - File changes needed
   - How images will be stored and referenced
   - Integration points with existing templates
   - Any new parameters or configuration needed

## Analysis Context

Based on examination of the codebase:
- Tutorials use `image = "images/tutorials/filename.png"` parameter
- Hugo resource processing with fingerprinting is used for image handling
- List pages show thumbnails, single pages show full images
- Presentations currently use different card styling (`app-card` vs `podcast-card`)
- Need to maintain consistency with existing patterns while adapting for presentation-specific requirements
