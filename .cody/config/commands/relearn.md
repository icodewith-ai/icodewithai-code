command: ":cody relearn"
description: It forces the AI AGENT to read again the Cody agent file to check for any updates.
agent-instructions: >
  Only tags that begin with <cf:...> must be executed as a Cody Framework component. 
  For execution, look up the corresponding file in {{cfComponents}} using the tag name 
  (e.g., <cf:table> → table.md, <cf:card> → card.md). 
  Standard HTML tags (e.g., <div>, <p>, <h1>) should not be executed.
  If you encounter a <cf:...> tag with no matching file, ask for clarification before proceeding.
