- Check that {{vdTemplates}}/work/feature-backlog.md does not exist.  
    If it does not:
        - Copy from {{vdTemplates}}/work/feature-backlog.md into {{vdWorkPhase}}
        - Review the plan.md document you created in the discovery phase, then generate and update the feature-backlog.md document.
        - When you are done, tell the USER to review it.   Also tell them they can type 'vibedocs work version' to start working on a version.
        - Stop here.
    If it does:
        - Tell the USER that work has already started.
        - Tell the USER that the Feature Backlog already exists.
        - Tell the USER they can work on a version next.
        - Stop here.
