# Release Retrospective â€“ v1.4.1-rename-to-show-and-tell
This document reflects on what worked, what didn't, and how future releases can be improved.

## Release Summary
Successfully completed comprehensive rebranding from "Built with Vibes" to "Show & Tell" across entire codebase. This involved 32 tasks across 7 phases, including directory structure changes, template updates, CSS renaming, configuration changes, content updates, testing, and final cleanup. All functionality maintained while transitioning to a more generic, universally understood name.

## What Went Well
_List things that were successful or effective during this release._

- **Systematic Approach**: The 7-phase breakdown from v1.4.0 provided an excellent foundation for this rename
- **Consistent Naming Convention**: Using "And" instead of "&" in variables maintained Hugo template compatibility
- **Template Variable Updates**: Successfully converted all variables to camelCase (`$showAndTellImg`, `$upcomingShowAndTell`)
- **Configuration Management**: Properly renamed site parameters from `tutorials` to `showandtell` and updated all references
- **Asset Management**: Icon file renaming and path updates handled seamlessly
- **Build System Robustness**: No build errors throughout the entire process
- **Incremental Validation**: User feedback during the process caught missing footer and variable references

## What Could Have Gone Better
_List things that caused friction, confusion, or delays._

- **Initial Template Oversight**: Missed updating some `$builtWithVibesImg` variable references in the first pass
- **Footer References Missed**: Initially overlooked updating footer navigation links
- **Parameter Naming**: Should have renamed `site.params.tutorials` to `site.params.showandtell` in the initial design phase

## Lessons Learned
_Both human and AI can add insights here. Focus on what to repeat or avoid in the future._

- **Template Variable Consistency**: Always search for ALL variable references, not just the primary ones
- **Configuration Parameters**: When renaming sections, consider updating the parameter names to match for consistency
- **Footer/Navigation**: Always check both header AND footer navigation references during rebranding
- **User Validation**: Having the user review and point out missed items is invaluable for quality assurance
- **Previous Version Templates**: Using a completed version's structure as a template speeds development significantly

## Action Items
_Concrete steps or process changes to carry forward into the next release._

- **Comprehensive Variable Search**: Use multiple search patterns to find ALL variable references (camelCase, kebab-case, original names)
- **Parameter Audit**: When renaming sections, create a checklist for all parameter references (config, templates, etc.)
- **Navigation Checklist**: Systematically check header, footer, mobile nav, and homepage references
- **Template Validation**: Always verify template variables match new naming conventions before marking tasks complete
- **User Review Process**: Build in user validation checkpoints to catch overlooked items
