I want to reorganize the bottom (footer) menu.

I'm focusing only on Navigation and Follow me.

Currently we have 2 columns.

Navigation

Bio
Apps
Blog
Podcast
Presentations
Contact
Discord

Follow Me
------------
GitHub
NPM
LinkedIn
YouTube
X

I would like to reorganize it into 5 columns

I also want to make sure the footer is responsive to the tablet-breakpoint.  Currently it's not.

Please review and ask any questions you may have and write them to the @bottom-QandA.md document.  I'll answer you there.
