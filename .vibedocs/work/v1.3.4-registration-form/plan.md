I want to create a notification system that users can sign up for in various places on my site.

I want the ability to embed this in any page on my site.  It should have the following fields.

=================================================================
GET NOTIFIED!
=================================================================
First Name: [          ] Last Name: [                     ]
Email Address: [                                          ]

[ ] Get an email reminder on this event.
[ ] Receive updates on future events.

[ SAVE REMINDER ]

=================================================================

I would like to have the user be able to save reminder in various palces on my site, but have it remember the user information (first name, last name and email).

I would like the user to be able check out all their reminders they have set up
