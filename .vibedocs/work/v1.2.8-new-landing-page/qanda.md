# Q&A for v1.2.8 New Landing Page Project

## Questions about Phase 1:

1. **Navigation Structure**: I see the current header navigation shows "Apps, Learn, Community, About". You want to add "Latest Content" before Apps, making it "Latest Content, Apps, Learn, Community, About". Should "Latest Content" be a simple link (like Apps) or a dropdown menu?

> Simple link.  I can move it on my own later if I change my mind.

2. **URL Structure**: You want the new page accessible via `/latest-content/`. Should this create a new content file at `/content/latest-content.md` or should it be handled differently in Hugo?

> What do you recommend.  My thought is that it's a simple landing page with dynamic content, so basically, it could just live in @themes/icodewithai/layouts, just like index.html. 

3. **Latest Content Page**: When you say "duplicate of the home page but without the hero", do you mean:
   - Copy all the sections (Latest Blog Posts, Latest Podcast Episodes, Latest Presentations, Latest Apps) but remove only the hero section?
   - Or copy the entire home page layout but modify it to exclude the hero?

> The easies would be to duplicate the page (copy the page and name it latest-content.html).  Then remove the hero section.  I would think.

4. **SEO Requirements**: Based on the memory.md file, I need to create a corresponding SEO file. Should I create `/data/seo/single-pages/latest-content.yaml` for this new page?

> yup.  Feel free to duplicate the homepage.yaml and rename it to latest-content.yaml, I will take care of updating the SEO later on my own.

5. **Page Title**: What should be the page title for the new "Latest Content" page? Should it be "Latest Content | iCodeWith.ai" or something else?

> Yes, but that's all coming from #4 and I'll take care of that.

6. **Footer Navigation**: You want to add "Latest Content" under the "Learn" section in the footer. I see the footer has both desktop and mobile versions - should "Latest Content" be added to both, and should it be positioned first in the Learn section or in a specific order?

> First is perfect.  In both mobile and desktop

## Questions about Phase 2:

7. **Hero Section**: After removing all latest content from the home page, only the Hero section will remain. Should the hero section stay exactly as it is now?

> Yes

8. **Start Learning Button**: You want a "Start Learning" button that links to the "latest-content" page. Should this be styled as a primary button (matching the site's existing button styles)? And should it be centered below the hero section?

> Yes

9. **Button Positioning**: When you say "in the middle", do you mean horizontally centered on the page, or centered within a container section?

> Horizontally centered on the page, below the tagline.

10. **Future Cards**: You mentioned adding cards below the button later. Should I leave space/placeholder for these cards, or just add the button for now?

> yes, maybe add 2 box cards in one row (with a fake heading) in the style of /about-marcelo/, where you see Quick Facts.   

## Technical Questions:

11. **Hugo Parameters**: I see the site uses `.Site.Params` for URLs (like `.Site.Params.apps`, `.Site.Params.blog`). Should I add a new parameter for the latest-content page, or handle it differently?

> Good catch.  Yes, plesae do.  Nothing should be hard coded.

12. **Content Structure**: Should the new `/latest-content/` page be a standalone page or should it be part of a section? This affects how Hugo handles it.

> It should work like index.html.  Is that what you mean?

13. **Testing**: Do you have a preferred local development command I should use to test the changes (like `hugo server` with specific flags)?

> You can use whatever works for you to test it.  I'll test as well.

Please let me know your answers to these questions, then I'll create the implementation plan.
