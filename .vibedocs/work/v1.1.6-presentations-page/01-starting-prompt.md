### Starting Prompt

I want to create a new section for presentations on my site.  It's going to be similar as the apps section, In fact, you can duplicate the same layout.

The heading of the page is "Presentations".

The presentation data I'll track is:

- Title
- Description
- Date and Time
- Presenters (This most likely will be 90+% of the time, but just in case I present with someone else.)
- Link More <link to an external presentation page>

I want a list page and n item page, in the style of the /layouts/apps.   I'm assuming we'll be entering the content in /content/presentations.

### Be strict about CSS

I have a full CSS design system.  Please make sure you follow that.  You should not have to create any new styles.

### Be sure it's responsive 
Make sure it follows the responsiveness of our site.
