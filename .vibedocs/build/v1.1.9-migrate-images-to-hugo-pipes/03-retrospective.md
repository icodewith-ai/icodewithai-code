## Key Technical Decisions 💡

### Hugo Pipes vs Static Files
**Decision**: Migrate profile, logo, and certificate images to Hugo Pipes  
**Rationale**: Enable cache busting, unify asset pipeline, improve performance  
**Outcome**: ✅ Successful migration with fingerprinted URLs and optimized delivery

### Favicon Management
**Decision**: Keep favicon files in static folder  
**Rationale**: Browser compatibility requirements, PWA icon standards  
**Outcome**: ✅ Optimal approach - favicons remain accessible while theme images get optimization

### Error Handling Strategy  
**Decision**: Implement conditional rendering for all images  
**Rationale**: Graceful degradation when images are missing or not found  
**Outcome**: ✅ Robust templates that handle missing images elegantly

### Fingerprinting Method
**Decision**: Use `resources.Fingerprint` instead of `resources.Minify`  
**Rationale**: PNG minification not supported by Hugo, fingerprinting provides cache busting  
**Outcome**: ✅ Achieved primary goal of cache busting with proper asset management

## Migration Results 📊

### Before Migration
- **Static files**: 13 total files in `/static/images/`
- **Cache busting**: Manual versioning required
- **Asset pipeline**: Inconsistent (SCSS/JS processed, images static)
- **Error handling**: Basic template logic

### After Migration  
- **Static files**: 9 files (favicon/PWA icons only)
- **Cache busting**: Automatic via fingerprinted URLs
- **Asset pipeline**: Unified processing for all asset types
- **Error handling**: Robust conditional rendering

### File Size Impact
- **marcelolewin.jpg**: 172KB (largest file migrated)
- **logo.png**: 12KB (used in header/footer)
- **cert-manager.png**: 26KB (certificate badge)
- **cert-professional.png**: 30KB (certificate badge)
- **Total migrated**: ~240KB moved to optimized pipeline

## Problem Solving 🔧

### Minification Challenge
**Issue**: Hugo's `resources.Minify` doesn't support PNG image formats  
**Solution**: Switched to `resources.Fingerprint` for cache busting  
**Result**: Achieved primary goal of cache invalidation without breaking build

### Static vs Assets Decision
**Issue**: Determining which images belong in static vs assets  
**Solution**: Theme images → assets, browser/PWA icons → static  
**Result**: Logical separation that optimizes each image type appropriately

### Template Reference Updates
**Issue**: Converting static paths to Hugo Pipes resource calls  
**Solution**: Systematic template updates with conditional rendering  
**Result**: Clean, maintainable template code with proper error handling
