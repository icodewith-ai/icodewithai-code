- **Standardized all link behaviors** with consistent animated underline hover effects

### üìê **Comprehensive Variable System**
- **50+ variables** now systematize every aspect of the design system
- **Complete opacity systematization** (10 opacity variables for all shadow and effect levels)
- **Animation standardization** (6 duration and timing variables)
- **Effect distance systematization** (5 variables for hover, slide, and underline effects)
- **Component dimension variables** (10 variables for consistent sizing)

### üìö **Professional Documentation**
- **Enhanced CSS Architecture Documentation** with comprehensive variable reference
