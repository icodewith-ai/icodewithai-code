# make sure you check out the memory.md file before reading this and anytime you need to remember something during this session.  Also, make sure you continue to update memory.md during the session, so just in case we get cut off or I need to /clear or /compact the session, you know what we have worked on.  Keep it to the bear minimum you need to understand this release.

We are going to work in phases.

For phase 1

I need you to create a new page called /latest-content.  THis page is a duplicate of the home page (/) but without the hero.  It will be accessible via /latest-content/.   The reasons I'm doing this is because I want to update the home page into a more landing page style and remove the latest content from there  But don't do that now.

I need you to then add to the header navigation, a new item called "Latest Content", before Apps.   So it will be "Latest Content, Apps, Learn, Community, About".   Make sure you do this for both the desktop and mobile apps.

Then I want you to do the same for the footer.   Add "Latest Content" under Learn header.  Remember to do both the desktop and mobile.

For phase 2

We are going to remove all the latest content from the home page. So that leaves only the Hero.

Below the hearo, I need a nice primar-button in the middle that says "Start Learning" and it links to the "latest-content" page.

THen below that we will be adding some cards.  But I'm not ready for that yet.   

Ask any questions you want.  Place those questions in the qanda.md file.  I'll read the questions and tell you "questions answered", at which point, you will re-read and ask more questions or tell me you are ready for the plan.

Once we are done with that, I'll say "create plan" and you will create a plan in the plan.md file.

We'll iterate on the plan and when you are satisfied with it, you'll tell me and I'll tell you to create the tasklist.  At which point, you will create phase1-tasklist.md file and we'll start.  Once we are done with phase 1, and I approve it, we'll move on to phase 2 and do the same process.
