- Implemented consistent full-screen behavior for both mobile and iPad breakpoints
- Eliminated unwanted edge spacing

### 2. Logo Positioning
- Fixed logo alignment issues in both breakpoints
- Adjusted padding and spacing to ensure consistent positioning
- Matched mobile and iPad logo placement for visual consistency

### 3. Navigation Spacing
- Standardized spacing between menu items
- Implemented consistent `gap: $spacing-md` across breakpoints
- Optimized top margin for better visual balance

## Technical Details

### Spacing Variables Used
- `$spacing-md`: Primary spacing for navigation items

- `$spacing-lg`: Used for larger spacing requirements
- `$spacing-xs`: Used for fine-tuning and minimal spacing needs

### Breakpoint-Specific Handling
- Mobile breakpoint: Zero edge spacing, optimized for smaller screens
- iPad breakpoint: Maintained consistent spacing while accommodating larger viewport
- Both breakpoints now share identical spacing between navigation items

## Testing Notes
- Verified layout in both mobile and iPad breakpoints
- Confirmed proper spacing and alignment across all screen sizes
- Ensured consistent behavior of interactive elements
- Validated proper case text display matches desktop navigation

## Future Considerations
- Monitor user feedback on full-screen coverage
- Consider adding subtle animations for menu transitions
- Keep spacing values in sync with any future design system updates
