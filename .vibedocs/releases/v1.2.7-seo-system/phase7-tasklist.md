## Files to be Created/Modified
- **Documentation files:**
  - Final user guides and tutorials
  - System architecture documentation
  - Troubleshooting and maintenance guides
- **Potential template cleanup:**
  - Remove any remaining hardcoded SEO
  - Update archetypes if needed
- **Final SEO system refinements:**
  - Any last optimizations or fixes

## Testing Strategy
1. **Comprehensive Site Audit**: Test every page type and section
2. **Content Creation Testing**: Create new content and verify SEO works
3. **Social Media Testing**: Test sharing across all platforms
4. **Search Engine Testing**: Validate structured data across all content
5. **Performance Testing**: Ensure build times and site speed are acceptable
6. **User Acceptance Testing**: Have content authors test the system

## URL Slug Decision Framework
**Recommendation: Keep slugs in content files**

**Reasons:**
- Slugs are part of content structure, not just SEO
- Hugo's built-in slug handling is robust
- Content authors naturally think of URLs when creating content
- Keeps content self-contained
- Avoids complexity of dual slug management

**If migrating slugs to SEO files:**
- Must handle fallbacks to content file slugs
- Requires more complex SEO partial logic
- Risk of URL inconsistencies
- More maintenance overhead

## Migration Documentation Sections
1. **System Overview**: How the centralized SEO system works
2. **Content Author Guide**: Day-to-day SEO management
3. **Developer Guide**: Technical implementation details
4. **Troubleshooting**: Common issues and solutions
5. **Best Practices**: SEO content guidelines
6. **Examples**: Real examples for each content type

## Final Deliverables
- [ ] Fully centralized SEO system with no legacy code
- [ ] Complete documentation suite
- [ ] Validated performance and scalability
- [ ] User training materials
- [ ] Maintenance and troubleshooting guides
- [ ] Sign-off on project completion
