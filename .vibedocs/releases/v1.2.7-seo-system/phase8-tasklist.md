# Phase 8: SEO Folder Structure Reorganization - Task List

## Overview
Reorganize the SEO content-types folder structure to improve maintainability and navigation as the site grows. Move individual entry files into `entries/` subfolders while keeping `listpage.yaml` files at the top level for easy access.

## Problem Being Solved
- **Current Issue**: `listpage.yaml` files get buried among individual entry files as content grows
- **Future Scalability**: With hundreds of blog posts, finding the list page configuration becomes difficult
- **Navigation Confusion**: No clear separation between list configuration and individual entries

## Proposed Solution
Create `entries/` subfolders within each content type to separate individual content files from list page configuration.

## Tasks

### 1. Backup and Planning (HIGH PRIORITY)
- [ ] Document current SEO partial logic for individual content detection
- [ ] Create backup of current folder structure
- [ ] Test current functionality to establish baseline

### 2. Create New Folder Structure (HIGH PRIORITY)
- [ ] Create `entries/` subfolder in `/data/seo/content-types/apps/`
- [ ] Create `entries/` subfolder in `/data/seo/content-types/blog/`
- [ ] Create `entries/` subfolder in `/data/seo/content-types/presentations/`
- [ ] Create `entries/` subfolder in `/data/seo/content-types/podcast/`

### 3. Move Individual Entry Files (HIGH PRIORITY)
- [ ] Move 3 app entry files to `/data/seo/content-types/apps/entries/`
- [ ] Move 8 blog entry files to `/data/seo/content-types/blog/entries/`
- [ ] Move 2 presentation entry files to `/data/seo/content-types/presentations/entries/`
- [ ] Leave all `listpage.yaml` files at top level (no changes needed)

### 4. Update SEO Partial Template (CRITICAL)
- [ ] **PRIMARY CHANGE**: Update `/themes/icodewithai/layouts/partials/seo.html`
- [ ] Modify individual content detection logic to look in `entries/` subfolder
- [ ] Update path from `index .Site.Data.seo "content-types" .Section` to include `entries`
- [ ] Ensure fallback logic still works correctly
- [ ] Keep list page logic unchanged (already works correctly)

### 5. Testing and Validation (HIGH PRIORITY)
- [ ] Test homepage SEO (should be unchanged)
- [ ] Test about page SEO (should be unchanged)
- [ ] Test all list pages (apps, blog, presentations, podcast - should be unchanged)
- [ ] Test individual apps with moved SEO files
- [ ] Test individual blog posts with moved SEO files
- [ ] Test individual presentations with moved SEO files
- [ ] Test content without custom SEO files (fallback behavior)

### 6. Documentation Updates (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
- [ ] Update `seo-maintenance.md` folder structure diagram
- [ ] Update custom images documentation paths
- [ ] Update YAML file naming convention documentation
- [ ] Update examples to reflect new structure

### 7. Final Validation (HIGH PRIORITY)
- [ ] Verify all SEO functionality works identically to Phase 7
- [ ] Check that list pages are easily discoverable
- [ ] Confirm individual entries are properly organized
- [ ] Test social media sharing across all page types

## Expected Code Changes

### SEO Partial Template Changes
**Location**: `/themes/icodewithai/layouts/partials/seo.html`

**Current logic** (around lines 37-42):
```go
{{/* Try to load individual content SEO file */}}
{{ with index .Site.Data.seo "content-types" .Section }}
  {{ $individualSEO := index . $contentSlug }}
  {{ if $individualSEO }}
    {{ $seoData = $individualSEO }}
```

**Updated logic** (expected):
```go
{{/* Try to load individual content SEO file from entries subfolder */}}
{{ with index .Site.Data.seo "content-types" .Section }}
  {{ with .entries }}
    {{ $individualSEO := index . $contentSlug }}
    {{ if $individualSEO }}
      {{ $seoData = $individualSEO }}
```

## New Folder Structure Result

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All `listpage.yaml` files are immediately visible at top level
- [ ] Individual entry files are organized in `entries/` subfolders
- [ ] SEO functionality works identically to Phase 7
- [ ] Template changes are minimal and contained to `seo.html` partial
- [ ] Documentation reflects new structure
- [ ] Future content additions follow new organization pattern

## Risk Assessment
**Low Risk**: This is primarily a file organization change
- **Template Changes**: Limited to one file (`seo.html` partial)
- **Data Structure**: No changes to YAML file contents
- **Functionality**: Should be identical behavior, just different file paths
- **Rollback**: Easy to revert by moving files back to original locations

## Files to be Created/Modified
- **Modified**: `/themes/icodewithai/layouts/partials/seo.html` (individual content path logic)
- **Modified**: `.vibedocs/reference-library/seo-maintenance.md` (documentation updates)
- **Created**: 4 new `entries/` directories
- **Moved**: 13 individual entry YAML files to new locations
- **Unchanged**: All `listpage.yaml` files remain in place

## Implementation Notes
- Keep `listpage.yaml` files at current locations (no changes to list page logic needed)
- Only individual content detection logic needs updating in SEO partial
- Test thoroughly but expect minimal risk since it's primarily organizational
- This sets up the structure for easy scaling as content grows

## Phase 8 Success Metrics
- **Organization**: `listpage.yaml` files are immediately discoverable
- **Scalability**: Structure can handle hundreds of entries cleanly
- **Functionality**: 100% identical SEO behavior to Phase 7
- **Maintainability**: Content authors can easily navigate and manage SEO files
