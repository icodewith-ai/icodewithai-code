Always check memory.md as you work in this release, located in the same folder as this file.  Make sure you read it first before reading this file.  Then proceed below.  Make sure you continuously update it as we work on this release.

In this release, @vibedocs/releases/v1.2.9-create-certification-page, we are going to update about-marcelo the following way:

1 - I want to remove the "certifications box" completely.
2 - I want to have the Quick Fact box expand to the width of the canvas (but make sure it's properly responsive.  We already have a breakpoint, only 1, for tablet, which we use for the entire site, so make sure you use that.  do not create a new breakpoint.)
3 - Above startsups I've built, we are going to duplicate that entire section (Startups I've built) and rename it to "My Certificates".  Leave 3 boxes for now.  The rest of the cards you can remove.
4 - For each box in number 3 above, we need to keep the title, the description, but I want to add a regular link (from our standard library) that says "See certificate" with a link.  I'll populate the links later.  I also want, to the left of the title, description and link, the image we had in Certifications section (see number 1 above).   Just one of those images.  I'll populate all the images in each box later, but for now, you can use the same image.  So this card will have 2 columns.  First Column, the image.  Second column the title, description and link.

If you have any questions, write them in the qanda.md file in this folder.  I'll answer you there.
