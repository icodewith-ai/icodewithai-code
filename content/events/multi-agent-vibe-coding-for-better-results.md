Traditional coding assistants like Claude Code or Cursor rely on a single, general-purpose agent. But what happens when you split that workload into multiple specialized agents? In this session, we'll explain the fundamentals of agents and subagents, explore how they work in both serialized and parallel setups, and show why these structures matter for vibe coding. Through real-time demos, you'll see how multi-agent systems reduce hallucinations, improve efficiency, and produce better coding outcomes.

Participation in the workshop is free and optional but highly encouraged. If you don't want to participate, free free to just hang out and watch.

For this month's workshop we'll break down key concepts, what agents are, how subagents fit in, and the differences between serialized vs. parallel execution, into short, digestible lessons. After each concept, we'll pause for a live demo so you can see it in practice. By connecting theory with hands-on demonstrations, you'll leave with a clear understanding of how the pieces of multi-agent vibe coding fit together into a powerful framework you can apply to your own workflows.
