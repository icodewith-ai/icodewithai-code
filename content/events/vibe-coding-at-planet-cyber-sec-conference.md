In this online presentation, I'll be focused on how to vibe code in a structured way using Spec Driven Development to deliver a scalable and maintainable app.  I'll cover:

- What is vibe coding, and how is it different from AI-assisted engineering?
- How good at coding should you be to vibe code?
- Why vibe coding doesn’t always deliver what you want
- Why the SDLC still matters, even when you’re moving fast
- An overview of spec driven development and frameworks
- Vibe coding tips and best practices
