## Introduction
Vibe coding is about building software in a conversational, collaborative flow with AI tools. Instead of spending hours writing code line-by-line, you work side-by-side with AI models to quickly prototype, iterate, and refine solutions. But just like any creative process, your results depend on how you approach it. Without a plan, you can end up stuck, going in circles, or producing code that works today but fails tomorrow.

Over the course of many vibe coding sessions, both successful and painful, I've collected a set of best practices that help keep vibe coding productive and structured.

This article will be continously updated with more best practices as I find them, so bookmark this page and check back often.

Let's get started!

## Mindset & Planning
Before you even open your AI tool, your mindset and preparation will set the tone for your entire vibe coding session. Clear thinking, well-defined goals, and disciplined scope help you move faster and avoid AI confusion. Think of this category as building the mental and strategic foundation that makes the rest of the session productive.

### Think like a systems architect
Instead of diving straight into prompts, step back and look at your project from a bird's-eye view. Identify the core components, how they connect, and where your AI coding assistant will fit into the process. This keeps you from painting yourself into a corner with design decisions that don't scale.

> _Before building a habit tracker, map out the flow: user authentication → data storage → habit tracking logic → reporting UI. Share that outline with the AI so it understands the architecture._

### Define your project vision clearly
If you can't explain your project in one or two sentences, you're not ready to start coding. A clearly defined vision aligns both you and the AI on the same outcome, avoiding wasted prompts and irrelevant suggestions. Work with AI to refine and clarify your vision so that you understand it before you expect the AI to understand it.

> _"A mobile-first recipe app for quick vegetarian meals under 30 minutes" tells the AI exactly what's in scope. "A recipe app" is too broad and invites feature bloat._

### Break the work into small, manageable steps
Big, vague prompts overwhelm AI and often lead to generic or messy code. Small, focused tasks keep responses on target and easier to test.

> _Instead of "Build the user profile page," start with "Create the profile form UI in React with Tailwind CSS, no functionality yet." Then iterate by adding logic and integrations in separate steps._

### Keep tasks focused
Multitasking with AI leads to context dilution. By keeping each request tightly focused, you give the model the best chance to deliver a useful, coherent result.

> _Don't ask, "Build the form, validate inputs, and connect to the API." Start with "Build the form HTML and styling" first, then handle validation, then API calls._

### Avoid scope creep
It's tempting to add "just one more feature" while you're in the flow, but scope creep disrupts focus and delays delivery. Keep a backlog or parking lot for new ideas and revisit them later.  

> _While building a blog template, you might think of adding a newsletter signup. Instead of coding it now, jot it down and file it under "Future Enhancements."_

### Know when to stop and ship
AI makes it easy to endlessly refine, but the goal is to deliver value, not perfection. At some point, good enough is good enough.

> _If your AI-generated weather widget works, meets requirements, and is stable, resist the urge to rewrite it just because the AI offers a "more optimized" version._

### Start with a small proof of concept
Before committing to a full build, validate that your idea works in a minimal, low-risk version. This helps identify feasibility and potential blockers early.  

> _If you're thinking of building an AI-powered image search, start by getting a single search query working on a small dataset before investing in a polished UI or advanced features._

### Keep an idea backlog
Ideas will pop up mid-session. Capture them without losing focus on the current task.

> _While coding a task manager, you think of adding recurring tasks. Drop it in a "Future Ideas" doc instead of stopping to build it._

## Tooling & Setup
The right tools and setup can make or break your vibe coding session. Choosing a reliable tech stack, testing different AI models, and having collaboration systems in place will help you work faster and with fewer roadblocks.

### Stick to a mainstream, well-documented tech stack
Choosing widely adopted tools ensures you'll have community support, good documentation, and plenty of examples when you need them.  

> _Instead of an obscure framework, pick React, Vue, or Svelte — all with robust communities and guides._

### Test different models
Different AI models excel in different tasks. Try a few and stick with the one that performs best for your project's needs.  

> _You may want to use GPT-5 for complex reasoning, Claude for structured code generation, and Gemini Code Assist for UI-heavy projects._

### Test different tools
The platform you use matters. Some AI coding environments integrate better with your stack or workflow than others.  

> _Compare the many available IDEs (integrated developer environments) to see which fits your style._

### Use parallel Development AI Agents
Divide work among different AI agents to accelerate development (in Claude Code, they are called sub-agents).

> _Have one agent write backend endpoints while another builds the frontend components._

### Use a shared workspace when collaborating
If you're working with others, keep the conversation and code in one shared environment so everyone stays in sync.  

> _Use a shared GitHub repository for both code and context. In the repo root, create a memory.md file where you log important prompts, AI-generated code snippets, and design decisions. Each time someone changes direction, they update memory.md. This way, any collaborator, or even you, coming back weeks later, can see the reasoning behind choices without digging through old chats._

## AI Collaboration
Working effectively with AI is a skill in itself. The better you communicate, the better your results. This category focuses on prompt design, context setting, and leveraging the AI's capabilities.

### Provide the AI with context and examples
AI performs best when it understands your environment and style.  

> _Instead of "Write a login function," say "Write a Node.js login function using Express and JWT, similar to this example..."_

### Reset or rephrase when you get stuck
If you're not getting good results and you keep going in circles with AI, start a brand new chat.  

> _When a CSS layout keeps breaking, restart the prompt with a simplified version of the layout requirements._

### If you have a preferred approach, say so
AI can produce results in many ways but remember that you can always tell it your preferred style upfront.  

> _"Write this function in a functional programming style" or "Use async/await syntax."_

### Give the AI a role or persona
Framing the AI as a specific "role" can improve output relevance.  This works extremely well when you are defining agents that are specialized.

> _"You are a senior Python backend engineer, specializing in secure code, reviewing my code."_

### Set constraints and acceptance criteria
Tell the AI what success looks like before it begins. Make sure you define "done" so it knows when a task is really complete.

> _"This API should respond in under 200ms and handle up to 10,000 requests per minute."_

### Use a structured prompt template
Consistency in your prompts makes it easier to compare results. It also makes it easier to predict the output.

> _You may define a template where you are always including "Goal," "Constraints," and "Example" sections in your requests._

### Clarify unknowns before coding
Ask the AI to explain concepts you're unclear about before generating code.  

> _"Explain the difference between shallow and deep copies in JavaScript before implementing this function."_

### Ask "what's missing?"
Let the AI help spot blind spots.  

> _"Here's my database schema — what indexes or relationships might I be overlooking?"_

## Technical Discipline
Strong fundamentals keep your project maintainable and scalable. Even with AI doing the heavy lifting, you still need to enforce good coding practices.

### Use version control or checkpoints
Save progress often so you can roll back if needed.  

> _Commit to Git after every major feature (dev branch, not main, unless it's been thoroughly tested!), or use save states in your AI tool._

### Think about naming conventions
Clear, consistent naming avoids confusion later.  

> _Stick with kebab-case for files, camelCase for variables, and PascalCase for components._

### Help the AI keep the code DRY
Make sure AI avoids duplicating code unnecessarily.

> _Extract repeated logic into a helper function instead of copying it into multiple files._

### Learn the basics and review the AI's code
Understand enough of the language to spot problems or inefficiencies.  

> _Don't deploy a Node.js app without knowing how async/await works._

### Validate performance and security
Don't just check that the code runs, make it fast and safe, specially if you are going to hold user's private information. At that point, you may want to involve a human in the loop to verify security.

> _"Test for SQL injection vulnerabilities before launch" or (better) "Hey John (real human developer), I need you to make sure these files are secure in this S3 bucket!"_

### Leverage AI for refactoring
Once it works, have the AI clean up and optimize your code, but make sure you checked in your working code first!

> _"Refactor this function for readability and performance, keeping the same functionality."_

## Testing & Documentation
A successful vibe coding session doesn't end when the code runs. Testing, documenting, and iterating keep your project stable and easier to build on later.

### Test the output and iterate frequently
Run and test your code often to catch issues early.  

> _After writing a function, test it immediately with sample data, including edge case scenarios._

### Document your process and decisions
Write down why you made certain choices.  

> _"Chose PostgreSQL over MongoDB for better relational data support."_

### Integrate continuous feedback
Don't wait until the end to test the whole app, test small parts regularly.  

> _Check a new component's rendering before hooking it into the entire UI._
