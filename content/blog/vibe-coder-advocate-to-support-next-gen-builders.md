*Vibe coders are reshaping how software gets built. Now is the time we support them with a new kind of advocate, focused on their needs.*


## Somethingâ€™s Changing in How We Build

Not long ago (earlier this year ðŸ˜‰), building apps meant knowing how to code. Developers were the builders, and everyone else submitted tickets.

But AI is shifting that.

Today, more and more non-developers are building automations, tools, and even full apps by talking to AI. We're writing prompts instead of code. Weâ€™re experimenting in Notion, Zapier, Airtable, Claude, and ChatGPT. Some (yours truly) are even creating full production apps and websites using advanced vibe coding tools such as Claude Code, Cursor, Amazon Kiro and Google Gemini Code Assist.

We're all building solutions to solve business problems, fast.

But with things changing at blazing speed, it's hard to know what the standards are, which tools to trust, or how to build something that lasts.

> Enter... the Vibe Coder Advocate

## Who Are Vibe Coders?

First, let me define who I'm speaking about when I talk about vibe coders. These are not your typical software engineers, but rather:

- Product managers
- Marketers
- Operations pros
- Analysts
- Content strategists
- And yes, maybe even developers

{{< space "1.5rem" >}}

What they share is a technical mindset and a desire to solve problems using modern tools. They may not know how to write full-blown code, but they know how to:

- Build workflows with AI and automation tools
- Talk to LLMs to get things done
- Prototype and ship internal tools without waiting for dev cycles

{{< space "1.5rem" >}}

Most importantly, they understand their business and their problems well enough to define and deliver working solutions. They're not "playing" with AI, they're delivering value with it.

## Why Do We Need a Vibe Coder Advocate When We Have a DevRel?

Developer Relations (DevRel) has been around for years. It's critical for empowering developers with the right tools, resources, and community. But vibe coders aren't developers. They don't want an SDK or API docs. They want:

- Real-world workflows and business-focused use cases
- Prompt libraries and sample content
- Best practices and emerging standards
- Tool-specific knowledge and community support

Developers are grounded in code, architecture, and scalability. Vibe coders are grounded in outcomes, speed, and business needs.

## Vibe Coder Advocate vs Developer Relations

Here's how the two roles differ â€” not in importance, but in **audience, mindset, and approach**:

### Developer Relations
- **Primary Audience:** Developers and engineers  
- **Main Goal:** Help devs integrate, build, and extend products  
- **Preferred Resources:** SDKs, API docs, code samples  
- **Common Tools:** REST APIs, SDKs, CLIs, GitHub  
- **Mindset:** Code-first, deep integration  
- **Community:** Forums, GitHub discussions, Stack Overflow  

### Vibe Coder Advocate
- **Primary Audience:** Non-dev technical users (PMs, marketers, analysts, ops, creators)  
- **Main Goal:** Help vibe coders solve business problems using AI tools  
- **Preferred Resources:** Prompt templates, workflows, use-case guides  
- **Common Tools:** ChatGPT, Claude Caude, Kiro, Notion AI, Replit, Airtable  
- **Mindset:** Outcome-first, rapid iteration  
- **Community:** Slack/Discord, live demos, office hours, meetups  

{{< space "1.5rem" >}}

These two roles are complementary, not competitive. Just as DevRel helped developers succeed with modern platforms, Vibe Coder Advocates will help this new generation of builders realize their ideas faster, even if theyâ€™ve never written a line of code.

## What a Vibe Coder Advocate Role Would Look Like

So what does this role actually do?

### Be fluent in the tools.
They need hands-on experience with tools like Claude Code, Amazon Kiro, Google Code Assist, ChatGPT, Claude, Replit, Zapier, Notion AI, Airtable, and more. Not just knowing what they do, but how they fit together to solve problems.

### Understand business use cases.
This person bridges the gap between tooling and outcome. They understand pain points across departments and help vibe coders find AI-assisted solutions that work.

### Teach through enablement.

- Create guided workflows
- Develop prompt libraries
- Create use-case playbooks
- Perform live demos
- Create nteractive content and templates
- Organize Meetups
- Create actual working apps and websites
- Write blog articles
- Create and host podcasts
- Create tutorials
- Create / follow / prompote standards and best practices

{{< space "1.5rem" >}}

### Foster community.
They create safe, supportive spaces for people to share, learn, and grow their skills â€” even if they don't identify as "technical."

### Close the feedback loop.
They collect insights from vibe coders and bring them back to product and engineering teams to improve the tools.

## Why This Role Matters Now

This isn't some niche idea. This is a necessary evolution. Vibe coders are shipping solutions every day. They're making business operations smoother, getting products to market faster, and freeing up developers to focus on more complex work.

But right now, they're doing it in isolation, without support, and often without knowing if they're doing it "right."

Thatâ€™s a missed opportunity. If we invest in them, theyâ€™ll go even further.

## What Companies Should Do

- Recognize the builders in your user base who arenâ€™t developers.
- Appoint or hire someone who understands these people and the tools they use.
- Create onboarding, guides, templates, and office hours just for them.
- Build a community that makes them feel seen and supported.
- Help them feel empowered and follow best practices to create a solution that lasts.

## The Call to Action

Vibe coders are here. Theyâ€™re building fast, smart, and differently.

They donâ€™t need code bootcamps or API docs. They need someone who understands what they're trying to do and helps them do it better.

Itâ€™s time for the **Vibe Coder Advocate**.
