​In today's fast-paced solo-dev world, vibe coding lets you brainstorm, prototype, and spin up MVPs or proofs of concept in minutes with no heavy processes required.

​But moving straight from an idea to AI-generated code can mean skipping vital steps like clarifying goals, defining scope, and capturing intent.

​In this session, we'll:

- ​Define vibe coding and how it differs from more traditional AI-assisted engineering.
- ​Walk through a lightweight framework—PRDs, feature plans, task breakdown, that channels your creative spark into organized artifacts.
- ​See real examples of how structure improves AI output.
- ​Build a small app live, so you can experience the flow from idea to structured code in real time.
