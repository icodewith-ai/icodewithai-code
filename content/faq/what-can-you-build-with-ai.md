You can build real-world, production-ready applications across many domains using AI tools including:

- **Web applications** using modern frameworks like Hugo, React, or Vue
- **Mobile apps** for iOS and Android
- **APIs and backend services** with proper database design
- **Marketing tools** and landing pages
- **Internal business tools** and automation
- **SaaS products** from MVP to full-featured platforms

But this means transitioning from being a Vibe Coder into a Professional Builder.
