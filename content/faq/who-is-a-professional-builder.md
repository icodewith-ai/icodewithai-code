A **Vibe Coder** uses AI to bring ideas to life without writing code themselves. They focus on creativity, problem-solving, and exploring what's possible through AI collaboration.

A **Professional Builder** also doesn't write code, AI handles that. But they use Spec Driven Development, frameworks, and systems thinking to guide the AI. They build consistently, efficiently, and at scale by understanding architecture, the SDLC, and how all the moving parts connect to deliver production-ready, maintainable apps.
