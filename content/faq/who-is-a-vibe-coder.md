Vibe coders are people who use AI to build software without writing code themselves. They have great ideas but may lack traditional programming skills.

They work by telling the AI tools what they want, iterating through conversation, experimentation, and intuition until something works. They're energized by the creative process and the speed at which they can bring ideas to life.

They create prototypes, validate ideas, and solve real problems. But they often hit walls when projects grow, requirements change, or they need to maintain what they've built. 

When that happens, it's time to become a Professional Builder.
