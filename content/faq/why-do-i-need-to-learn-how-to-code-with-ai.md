In the near future, coding with AI won't just be for developers, it'll be a core skill for anyone who needs to turn ideas into working software quickly.

- **Product Managers** will validate features and build prototypes without waiting on engineering sprints.
- **Business Analysts** will transform requirements into functional demos that stakeholders can actually interact with.
- **Marketing Managers** will create custom tools, dashboards, and campaign microsites on demand.
- **Content Strategists** will build interactive experiences and content platforms tailored to their audience.
- **UX Designers** will prototype real, working interfaces, not just mockups, to test with users.
- **Project Managers** will spin up project tracking tools, automation workflows, and team dashboards customized to their process.

The common thread? These roles already understand problems, users, and systems. AI removes the technical barrier, making "builder" a natural extension of what they already do. 

The question isn't if you need this skill, it's when your organization expects you to have it.
