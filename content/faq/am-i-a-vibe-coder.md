Vibe coders are people who use AI to build software without writing code themselves. 

- You have great ideas but may lack traditional programming skills.
- You work by telling the AI tools what you want, iterating through conversation, experimentation, and intuition until something works. 
- You're energized by the creative process and the speed at which you can bring ideas to life.
- You create prototypes, validate ideas, and solve real problems. But you often hit walls when projects grow, requirements change, or you need to maintain what you've built. 

When that happens, it's time for you to become a Product Builder.
