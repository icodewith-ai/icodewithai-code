**Spec Driven Development (SDD)** is an approach where you, along with AI, start by clearly defining what you're building before AI writes any code. It centers around creating structured specifications, like feature definitions, user stories, and requirements using AI, that guide every stage of the development. By doing this, you and AI share the same understanding of the product, reduce AI rework, and make it easier to move from idea to implementation efficiently and consistently.

There are various frameworks today that support Spec Driven Development, including our very own, [Cody Framework](https://github.com/ibuildwith-ai/cody-framework).
