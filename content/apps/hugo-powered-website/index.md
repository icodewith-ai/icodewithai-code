### About
This (where you are at now) is the first site I've vibe coded from scratch. After relying on tools like Wix and Framer, I wanted full control againâ€”and I got it. It's also my first time using the Hugo SSG framwework, and I'm quickly seeing the benefits of static site generators: fast performance, a lightweight codebase, and clean, responsive output.
