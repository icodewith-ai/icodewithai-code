Get a deep-dive into AI development agents designed for professionals who work alongside development teams but don't write code daily. This session explains how specialized AI agents are changing software development workflows and what technical leaders need to know about this emerging technology. 

You'll learn:
- How AI development agents differ from general AI tools
- The architecture behind sub-agent systems:
    - Context isolation
    - Specialization
    - Coordination patterns: parallel vs. sequential
    - Communication with orchestration agent
- Real-world use cases: code analysis, security auditing, testing automation
- Sub-Agent examples in Claude Code
    - How to create them
    - How to use them
