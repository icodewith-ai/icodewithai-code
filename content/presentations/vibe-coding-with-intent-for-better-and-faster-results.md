In today’s fast-paced solo-dev world, vibe coding lets you brainstorm, prototype, and spin up MVPs or
proofs of concept in minutes—no heavy processes required. But moving straight from an idea to AI-
generated code can mean skipping vital steps like clarifying goals, defining scope, and capturing intent.


> The result? 

AI can spit out non-working, confusing code that gets lost in its own context, ends up scattered
and unstructured, and ultimately won’t scale or stick around when you need to build on it.

> What if you could keep the spontaneity but add just enough structure?

In this session, we’ll:

- Define vibe coding and how it differs from more traditional AI-assisted engineering.
- Walk through a lightweight framework—PRDs, feature plans, task breakdowns—that channels
your creative spark into organized artifacts.
- See real examples of how structure improves AI output.
- Build a small app live, so you can experience the flow from idea to structured code in real time.

Make sure to bring your laptop to follow along—we’ll be using Cursor, Claude Code, ChatGPT, Claude Chat,
and a few other vibe-coding tools.
Audience
This session is geared toward non-developers (though having a technical background will help); if you’re a
developer curious about vibe coding, you’ll find it a great intro as well.
