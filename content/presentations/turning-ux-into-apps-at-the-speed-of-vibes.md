In this session, we’ll explore how AI-assisted vibe coding turns UX designs into fully functional apps. You’ll see how modern tools like Figma MCP, Microsoft Copilot, and structured design systems work together to bridge the gap between user experience and implementation.

Topics covered include:

- How design systems lay the foundation for AI-assisted app creation
- Using Figma MCP to extract structure, components, and logic from UX mockups
- Translating UX screenshots into working prototypes with AI tools
- Leveraging Microsoft Copilot to accelerate interface and code generation
- The role of vibe coding in connecting design intent to functional output
- Practical tips for going from concept to deployable app

You’ll leave with a clear understanding of how AI and vibe coding connect design and development, turning UX concepts into real, working apps faster than ever before.

### About the Workshop

In this working session, we’ll take a real Figma UX design and bring it to life using Microsoft Copilot and vibe coding techniques. You’ll follow step-by-step as we import and interpret Figma designs, generate and refine front-end code with Copilot, structure the app around reusable components, apply vibe coding principles for effective AI collaboration, and deploy a fully functional prototype—bridging the gap between design and development in real time.
