Marketing doesn't stand still and neither should the tools marketers rely on. In this session, Erin Carpenter, Sr. Digital Marketing Director at e360, will share how she applies Vibe Coding techniques with platforms like Lovable to rapidly prototype and launch marketing apps. She'll walk us through her process of turning campaign ideas into functional apps, automation workflows, and interactive tools, all without the overhead of traditional development cycles.

Topics covered include:

- Should you buy vs. build.
- Important components to consider for vibe coding an app
- How vibe coding accelerates marketing experimentation.
- Choosing the right stack and tools for quick-turn projects.
- Balancing speed with scalability and maintainability.
- Real-world examples of marketing apps Erin has built with AI-assisted coding.
- Lessons learned from experimenting, iterating, and deploying at the pace of marketing.

You'll will leave with a clear understanding of how Vibe Coding can give marketing teams the power to build faster, test smarter, and adapt quickly to shifting customer demands.

After the presentation, Erin will lead a hands-on workshop where participants put Vibe Coding into practice. This workshop will walk you step-by-step through the process of creating a simple but impactful marketing app or tool using Lovable (or similar platforms). The workshop is designed to be accessible for non-developers while still providing depth for technical participants. Everyone will walk away with a functioning prototype and the confidence to apply vibe coding techniques to their own marketing challenges.
