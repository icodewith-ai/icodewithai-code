In today’s fast-paced solo-dev world, vibe coding empowers you to brainstorm, prototype, and 
launch MVPs or proofs of concept in minutes—no heavy processes required. But when you jump 
straight from idea to AI-generated code, you risk skipping key steps like clarifying goals, 
defining scope, and capturing your intent.


> The result?

Confusing, non-working code that lacks structure, gets lost in its own context, and won’t scale when you need to build on it.

> What if you could keep the spontaneity but add just enough structure?

In this session, we’ll:
- Define vibe coding and how it differs from traditional AI-assisted engineering.
- Introduce a lightweight framework (PRDs, feature plans, task breakdowns) to channel your ideas into structured artifacts.
- Show real-world examples of how structure improves AI-generated code.
- Share best practices for a successful vibe coding session.
- Build a small app live using Amazon Kiro IDE.
