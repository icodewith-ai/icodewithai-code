Vibe coding is fast, intuitive, and incredibly fun—but if you’ve ever ended a session with scattered files, unclear goals, or code that doesn’t quite work, you’re not alone. In this presentation, we’ll explore what vibe coding really is and how it differs from traditional AI-assisted software development. It’s more than just prompting an AI and hoping for the best—it’s a new way of building that blends creativity, iteration, and rapid prototyping.

But here’s the catch: without structure, vibe coding can fall apart. We’ll look at common pitfalls—like unclear intent, missing context, and lack of planning—that often lead to broken or unmaintainable code. Even in a world powered by AI, the fundamentals of software development still matter. The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) isn’t going away—it’s just evolving to work alongside new tools and faster workflows.

We’ll show you how to bring structure to your vibe coding sessions without killing the vibe. That includes an introduction to Vibedocs, a lightweight documentation framework designed to help you capture intent, plan features, track tasks, and keep your AI output focused. We’ll also highlight other documentation approaches that support structured creativity.
