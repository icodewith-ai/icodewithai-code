You’ve built your app, now it’s time to share it with the world! In this session, we’ll break down the publishing process for vibe-coded apps into simple, practical steps. From choosing the right hosting platform and automating deployments to handling secrets, testing in staging, and shipping your first version, you’ll learn how to go live with confidence. We’ll cover common pitfalls, pro tips, and mindset shifts that make publishing smoother and less intimidating—plus why every launch, big or small, deserves a celebration.

Participation in the workshop is free and optional but highly encouraged. If you don't want to participate, free free to just hang out and watch.

For this month’s workshop, we’ll take a simple vibe-coded app and walk through the steps to get it live. Bring your laptop, your favorite AI coding agent (Cursor, Claude Code, VS Code, etc.), and be ready to push your project out into the world. We’ll cover hosting options, setting up deployments, and publishing so others can actually use what you’ve built.
